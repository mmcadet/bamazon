# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


## Submission Guide

Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.

* Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).
