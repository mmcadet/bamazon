# bamazon

This is an Amazon-like storefront that uses node.js and mySQL. This application can take orders from customers and update the stores inventory.

The Javascript file bamazonCustomer.js will print the available Bamazon products to the store. 
The store will prompt the customer on which product they would like to purchase by ID number and ask for the amount ot the product that would like to be purchased.

If there is an appropriate amount of the product in stock, the store will return the total for that purchase. Otherwise, it will let the customer know that there isn't enough of the product in stock. 
If the purchase goes through, it updates the stock quantity to reflect the purchase.
