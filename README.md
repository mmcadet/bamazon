# bamazon

This is an Amazon-like storefront that uses node.js and mySQL. This application can take orders from customers and update the stores inventory.

**As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


* Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).


Javascript:
